              When you are tangled on the ground<br />
              <br />
              To find the silver lining<br />
              in the darkest of those clouds<br />
              <br />
              To look an enemy eye to eye<br />
              And not fear their secrets or lies<br />
              <br />
              To feel their hateful words<br />
              But feel no need to start a rise<br />
              <br />
              To remember that a storm<br />
              Brings the rainbows to your door<br />
              <br />
              That you are strong enough<br />
              For even the worst of the storms<br />
              <br />
              To believe in yourself<br />
              Even when you have been so very lost<br />
              <br />
              To follow your dreams, and not give up,<br />
              No matter all the cost.<br />
              <br />
              Resilience is truly brave.<br />
              In itâ€™s own extraordinary right.<br />
              <br />
              To have experienced the demons reach to grab you,<br />
              And still keep searching for the light.<br />
